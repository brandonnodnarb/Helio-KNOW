# Helio-KNOW
Software and systems for improved information representation in Heliophysics

The complexity and variability of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere (SWMI) system, particularly the auroral high latitudes, represents a pressing challenge to the fundamental understanding of the Heliophysics system. Among the most important and yet uncertain aspects of the SWMI system is energy and momentum coupling between regions, which is accomplished by electromagnetic fields, or Poynting Flux (PF), and the transfer of charged particles.

The Heliophysics KNOWledge Network (Helio-KNOW) is a new and possibly disruptive data analytic approach for a system-level understanding and prediction of MI coupling phenomena, applicable to our diverse multi-point, multi-parameter, sparsely-sampled SWMI datasets.

This repository holds the development, software, tools, and exploration to develop Helio-KNOW.
