coronal mass ejection (cme),"Not to be confused with the intense burst of light that is a solar flare, a CME is a cloud of magnetized solar material that erupts from the sun's atmosphere, the corona, into interplanetary space. CMEs do often occur at the same time as a flare, and scientists currently study how the two phenomena connect. At their largest, CMEs can contain 10 billion tons of matter, and they can move at speeds of a million miles an hour. Just after blowing into space, a CME cloud can grow as wide as 30 million miles across, 35 times the diameter of the sun. When a coronal mass ejection points toward Earth, it can take anywhere from one to three days to reach our atmosphere, where it can create a type of space weather known as a geomagnetic storm.",nasa
geomagnetically induced current (gic),"The magnetic fluctuations caused by a geomagnetic storm in Earth's magnetosphere, can cause electric currents to form currents on Earth. These geomagnetically induced currents, or GICs, can overload circuits, tip breakers, and in extreme cases destroy transformers.",nasa
interplanetary magnetic field (imf),"As the solar wind flows outward from the sun at several million miles per hour, it drags the sun's magnetic field with it. This magnetic field permeates the solar system and is known as the interplanetary magnetic field. While the IMF typically deflects around Earth's magnetic field, the IMF can sometimes ""reconnect"" with Earth's field, allowing solar wind energy to funnel directly into our protective magnetospheric bubble.",nasa
magnetic field lines,"A magnetic field has both a strength and a direction at each point in space. For example, at each point on Earth, the magnetic field -- and thus a compass -- points in a particular direction, roughly toward the north. Magnetic fields are therefore generally represented as lines: the direction of the line gives the direction of the field, and the closeness of the lines indicates the strength.",nasa
plasma,"The material in the sun and its atmosphere -- as well as the material in Earth's ionosphere, aurora and fluorescent lights -- are all plasmas. Plasma is a state of matter much like solid, liquid and gas. Plasmas are so incredibly hot, that the electrons leave their atoms, making it essentially a gas of charged particles. While uncommon on Earth, 99% of the matter we can see in the universe is made of plasma. The electrical charge strongly affects how the particles move, since the particles are simultaneously governed by, and constantly creating, magnetic fields. For example, in close-up images of solar activity you can see the plasma very clearly following the magnetic field lines. Conversely, as plasma moves, it drags its own magnetic fields along for the ride. This constant interchange is one reason why studying the dynamics of plasma on the sun or in the magnetosphere is so challenging.",nasa
prominences,"Huge columns of gas arcing out over the sun's limb or horizon. When the same structures are seen against the backdrop of the sun, they are called filaments. They are made of cooler solar material, or plasma, supported in the sun's atmosphere by magnetic fields. Prominences and filaments can erupt from the Sun with tremendous energy and are sometimes the source of coronal mass ejections.",nasa
radiative zone,"In the radiative zone, energy from the core slowly travels outward. This region is so dense that the Sun's energy takes about 150,000 years to work its way through.",nasa
solar energetic particles (sep),"During an eruptive event on the sun, the sun can emit very fast, very energetic particles that travel at about 80% the speed of light. Such charged particles can reach Earth's magnetosphere either in the wake of a flare, or propelled ahead of a coronal mass ejection. In either case the energy they dump into the atmosphere can create what's called a solar radiation storm, which can cause low frequency radio blackouts at Earth.",nasa
solar maximum,The time during the 11-year solar cycle when the number of sunspots -- and solar activity -- reaches a maximum. The next solar maximum is predicted for late 2013.,nasa
solar minimum,"The time during the 11-year solar cycle when the number of sunspots is lowest. This is also the time when the sun's magnetic fields are at their most simple, with relatively orderly magnetic field lines connecting magnetic north and south much like on a simple bar magnet.",nasa
sun spots,"Dark areas on the solar surface that contain constantly shifting strong magnetic fields. An average sunspot is about as large as Earth and it moves along with the sun's rotation, lasting for days or even weeks. The magnetic activity in sunspots can give rise to various solar eruptive events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The number of sunspots on the sun wax and wane over approximately an 11-year cycle, thus defining what is called the solar cycle. They appear dark since they are cooler than the surrounding solar material.",nasa
