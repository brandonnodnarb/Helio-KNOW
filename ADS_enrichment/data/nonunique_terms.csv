aurora,An atmospheric phenomenon consisting of bands of light caused by charged solar particles following the earth's magnetic lines of force.,spase
geomagnetic storm,A magnetospheric disturbance typically defined by variations in the horizontal component of the Earth's surface magnetic field. The variation typically starts with a field enhancement associated with a solar wind pressure pulse and continues with a field depression associated with an enhancement of the diamagnetic magnetospheric ring current.,spase
magnetic field,"A region of space near a magnetized body where magnetic forces can be detected (as measured by methods such as Zeeman splitting, etc.).",spase
magnetosphere,"The region of space above the atmosphere or surface of the planet, and bounded by the magnetopause, that is under the direct influence of the planet's magnetic field.",spase
substorm,A process by which plasma in the magnetotail becomes energized at a fast rate.,spase
