geomagnetic storm,A magnetospheric disturbance typically defined by variations in the horizontal component of the Earth's surface magnetic field. The variation typically starts with a field enhancement associated with a solar wind pressure pulse and continues with a field depression associated with an enhancement of the diamagnetic magnetospheric ring current.,spase
heliosheath,The region extending radially outward from the heliospheric termination shock and in which the decelerated solar wind plasma is still significant.,spase

mars,The forth planet from the sun in our solar system.,spase
mercury,The first planet from the sun in our solar system.,spase
mesosphere,"The layer of the atmosphere that extends from the Stratosphere to a range of 80 km to 85 km, temperature decreasing with height.",spase

pluto,The ninth (sub)planet from the sun in our solar system.,spase
ring current,"One of the major current systems confined within planetary magnetospheres. The ring current circles in the magnetic equatorial plane of magnetospheres. It is generated by the longitudinal drift of energetic charged particles trapped on inner, dipole-like magnetospheric field lines. At the Earth, the ring current is carried by 10 to 200 keV charged particles typically located at L-shells between 3 and 6. The ring current is also the primary driver of the Sym H and Dst Indices of magnetic storm activity at the Earth.",spase

triton,The largest moon of Neptune.,spase
troposphere,"The lowest layer of the atmosphere which begins at the surface and extends to between 7 km (4.4 mi) at the poles and 17 km (10.6 mi) at the equator, with some variation due to weather factors.",spase
uranus,The eighth planet from the sun in our solar system.,spase
venus,The second planet from the sun in our solar system.,spase
aurora,"An aurora is a natural display of light in the night sky that typically occurs in far northern and southern regions. Auroras occur when incoming charged particles from the sun strike oxygen and nitrogen some 60 to 200 miles up in Earth's atmosphere and release a flash of light and heat. Electrons and protons released by solar storms add to the number of solar particles, and can create bright auroras at lower latitudes.",nasa
chromosphere,"The relatively thin layer of the solar atmosphere located above the sun's surface. The temperature in the chromosphere rises from 6000° K to about 20,000° K, making it hotter than the photosphere but not as hot as the higher atmosphere, the corona.",nasa
corona,"The sun's dynamic atmosphere is called the corona. It is filled with electrically charged particles, whose movements are governed by the tangle of magnetic fields surrounding the sun. While the sun's surface is 6000K, the corona can reach up to millions of degrees, sparking questions from researchers on mechanisms heat the atmosphere so dramatically. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections originate in the corona.",nasa
geomagnetic storm,"One of the most common forms of space weather, a geomagnetic storm refers to any time Earth's magnetic environment, the magnetosphere, undergoes sudden and repeated change. Geomagnetic storms can be caused by high-speed blasts of the solar wind and when a CME connects up with the magnetosphere. The sun's magnetic fields peel back the outermost layers of Earth's fields changing the very shape of the magnetosphere. Magnetic storms have measurable effects worldwide, such as radio communication blackouts and power grid failures.",nasa
heliosphere,"The heliosphere is our entire solar system, as defined by the bubble created by the outflow of particles from the sun called the solar wind, which streams far past the outermost planets, six to nine billion miles away from the sun. Solar particles speed outward from the sun, pushing back the material in the rest of space, known as the interstellar medium. The boundary between the two defines the edges of the heliosphere.",nasa
ionosphere,"The ionosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere that extends from about 50 to 300 miles above the surface of the planet. The layer is filled with electrically charged particles (as well as neutral ones) and it is sensitive to incoming material from the sun, so the ionosphere can respond dramatically to space weather. Since the ionosphere is home to low Earth-orbiting spacecraft, as well as the region of space through which radio communications travel, unexpected changes in the region can have a dramatic effect on human technology.",nasa
magnetic field,"A field of force generated by electrical currents, which guides the motion of anything electrically charged. Earth and the sun and several planets have giant magnetic fields surrounding them, which roughly link north and south poles along lines of magnetic force known as magnetic field lines.",nasa
magnetosphere,"The magnetosphere is a bubble of magnetic fields that surrounds Earth, created by the natural magnetism of the planet. The magnetosphere protects humans on Earth from incoming energy from the sun, however it does change shape and size in response to such space weather, and these fluctuations can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected electrical surges in power grids.",nasa
magnetotail,"Earth's magnetotail drags out behind it, shaped by the flow of the solar wind on the night side of Earth. It extends over a hundred thousand miles and can collect much incoming energy from the sun, before releasing it toward Earth or further down the tail.",nasa
photosphere,The surface layer of the sun that we can see in the visible light range.,nasa
radiation belts,"Two belts of radiation that surround Earth, also known as the Van Allen Belts. These two concentric donut-shaped regions are filled with high-energy particles from the sun and Earth’s ionosphere that gyrate, bounce and drift, sometimes shooting down into Earth’s atmosphere, sometimes escaping out into space. The inner belt is fairly stable; however, the outer belt can swell and shrink over time, sometimes inflating so much that the belts appear as one.",nasa
solar cycle,"The sun goes through 11-year variations or cycles of high and low activity – solar flares and coronal mass ejections, for example, based on the regular increase and decrease of sunspots. Cycles as short as 9 years and as long as 14 years have also been observed. The cycle is caused by the fact that the sun's magnetic north and south poles flip every 11 years.",nasa
solar flares,"A great burst of light and radiation due to the release of magnetic energy on the sun. Flares are by far the biggest explosions in the solar system, with energy releases comparable to billions of hydrogen bombs. The radiation from the flare travels at the speed of light, and so reaches Earth within eight minutes. The energy is generally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, which protects humans on Earth, however, the energy can cause radio blackouts on Earth for minutes or, in the worst cases, hours at a time. The radiation from a flare would also be harmful to astronauts outside of Earth's atmosphere. Some, but by no means all, flares have an associated coronal mass ejection (CME).",nasa
solar wind,"The constant stream of solar coronal material that flows off the sun. The solar wind is much less dense than the wind on Earth -- indeed it can be 1000 times less dense than a man-made vacuum on Earth -- but it is much faster, typically moving at speeds of one to two million miles per hour. Indeed, it is constantly on the move: there is no place within the solar system where the solar wind's velocity is zero.",nasa
substorm,"A release of magnetic energy that originates in Earth's magnetotail, drawing on energy funneled there from the solar wind and other solar events. Substorms are fairly common and when they release energy toward Earth, the energy flows down the magnetic field lines toward Earth's north and south poles, causing aurora.",nasa
