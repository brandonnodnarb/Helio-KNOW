This is a directory that is dedicated to the project of enriching Heliophysics representation in the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). 

The objectives are to:

Create a set of concepts and their semantic representation that extends the coverage of Heliophysics literature by NASA ADS; Provide that extension in manner interoperable with the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus

Produce recommendations (in the form of reports and demos) for a structure of Heliophysics scientific concepts to guide Heliophysics information infrastructure development (separate from NASA ADS)


There are many useful resources, but an important one is the list of existing space weather/heliophysics vocabularies that provide a basis and need to be harmonized: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15D5tm6TchdZXfwjnDpJMh8ICCsU4C3qGM-amX9YjZkM/edit?usp=sharing

Additionally, a description of what is meant by glossary harmonization is provided here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fseFYXc07IwUGChtTH5YboNR5Ce_tyla/view?usp=sharing (which was created as part of an Earth Science Informatics Partners (ESIP) Funding Friday grant in Summer 2021)
