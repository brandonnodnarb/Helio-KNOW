This is a directory that is dedicated to the project of enriching Heliophysics representation in the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). The overarching goal is to develop the software and infrastructure for enriching [NASA Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) with Heliophysics terms

The objectives are to:
1. Create a set of concepts and their semantic representation that extends the coverage of Heliophysics literature by NASA ADS; Provide that extension in manner interoperable with the [Unified Astronomy Thesaurus](https://github.com/astrothesaurus/UAT); and 

2. Produce recommendations (in the form of reports and demos) for a structure of Heliophysics scientific concepts to guide Heliophysics information infrastructure development (separate from NASA ADS)

It is funded by the NASA Heliophysics Digital Resource Library (HDRL) and in-part supported by the NASA ADS team and the [NASA Center for HelioAnalytics](https://dev.helioanalytics.io/). 




There are many useful resources, but an important one is the list of existing space weather/heliophysics vocabularies that provide a basis and need to be harmonized: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15D5tm6TchdZXfwjnDpJMh8ICCsU4C3qGM-amX9YjZkM/edit?usp=sharing

Additionally, a description of what is meant by glossary harmonization is provided here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fseFYXc07IwUGChtTH5YboNR5Ce_tyla/view?usp=sharing (which was created as part of an Earth Science Informatics Partners (ESIP) Funding Friday grant in Summer 2021)
